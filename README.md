# IgniteCove App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

First things first, checkout from the main Development branch, create your dev branch.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Install an Emulator: Specifically Android. Set up instructions: [Link to installation](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)

3. Set up Android Studio. Please don't use Expo Go. Ensure adb is reachable. [Comprehensive setup instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&platform=android&device=simulated)

4. Create a Development Build either locally or ,preferably, use EAS. [Comprehensive setup instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/). Automatically installs the APK to the emulator.

5. Run ``` npm expo start ``` and eventually type "a" to run the Android-build.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
